# CSCI-340
Projects from Hunter College's CSCI-340 Operating Systems Analysis

The project creates a mock operating system, simulating how disks handle processes and how the OS manages everything. This project handles forks, process queues, and the entire process lifespan from being created to waiting and then finally to termination.
